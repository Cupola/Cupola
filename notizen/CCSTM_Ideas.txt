==== Thoughts on CCSTM ==== (02-jul-10)

we could maybe use dedicated roll-backs to modify behaviour lazily.
for instance, imagine a mapping action that includes a veto if
running processes need to be stopped and restarted, such that
the veto's effect is that the plain txn is roll-back and
_instead retried with a crossfade_!

gracefull rollbacks will also allow us to easily create
generative structures that just "try" if connections are possible
(topology-wise).
