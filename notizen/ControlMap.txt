TYPE       EDGE?  POSSIBLE SYNTH POS       DECIDED SYNTH POS

kr -> kr   (-)*   (irrelevant)             head(tgt)
kr -> ar   (-)*   before tgt               head(tgt)
ar -> kr   (-)*   after src                tail(src)
ar -> ar   +      before tgt && after src  tail(src)

* : if we do not enforce an edge, we could experience
    an extra latency of control-bus period
--> AT THE MOMENT, FORGET ABOUT IT (we don't care for this latency)


Effect on Proc group

--> enforce play-group
---> i.e. if play-group does not exist :
	--> enforce proc-group
	--> create play-group in proc-group
--> head(tgt) then means: before(play-group(tgt))
--> tail(src) then means: after(play-group(src))
