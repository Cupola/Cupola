h2. README

This project currently combines three different projects which will eventually go in separate repositories:

* Sound Processes (aka ScalaCollider-Proc) : a system based on ScalaCollider to describe and control sound processes
* Wolkenpumpe : the new scala'fied version of my live improvisation instrument becomes more light-weight, as the actual sound processes are just based on ScalaCollider-Proc ; that reduces Wolkenpumpe to the GUI which is currently done using Prefuse
* Cupola : the actual sound composition for the Mind Cupola project (sources not of general interest). Sits on top of Wolkenpumpe
